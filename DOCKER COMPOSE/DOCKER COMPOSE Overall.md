## DOCKER COMPOSE OVERALL


**Docker Compose** is a tool that is used for defining and running multi-container Docker apps in an easy way. It provides a configuration file called `docker-compose.yml` that can be used to bring up an application and the suite of services it depends on with just one command.


Docker Client itself:

> That's what Docker is about: running processes. 

> Now Docker offers a quite rich API to run the processes: shared volumes (directories) between containers (i.e. running images), forward port from the host to the container, display logs, and so on. But that's it: Docker as of now, remains at the process level.

Docker Compose as a help:

> While Docker Client provides options to orchestrate multiple containers to create a single "app", it doesn't address the managemement of such group of containers as a single entity. 

> And that's where tools such as Fig (now it's Docker Compose) come in: talking about a group of containers as a single entity. Think "run an app" (i.e. "run an orchestrated cluster of containers") instead of "run a container".
