### OVERALL INFO

VM vs. Container:
  - The VM is a *hardware abstraction*: it takes physical CPUs and RAM from a host, and divides and shares it across several smaller virtual machines. There is an OS and application running inside the VM, but the virtualization software usually has no real knowledge of that.
  - A container is an *application abstraction*: the focus is really on the OS and the application, and not so much the hardware abstraction. Many customers actually use both VMs and containers today in their environments and, in fact, may run containers inside of VMs.
