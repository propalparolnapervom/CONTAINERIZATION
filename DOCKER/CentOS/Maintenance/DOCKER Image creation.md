## COMMANDS


### RUN

The `RUN` instruction will execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results. The resulting committed image will be used for the next step in the `Dockerfile`.


Layering `RUN` instructions and generating commits conforms to the core concepts of Docker where commits are cheap and containers can be created from any point in an imageâ€™s history, much like source control.


> `RUN` actually runs a command and commits the result; `CMD` does not execute anything at build time, but specifies the intended command for the image.


### CMD

The primary purpose of `CMD` is to tell the container which command it should run when it is started.
